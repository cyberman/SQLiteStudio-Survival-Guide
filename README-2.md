# SQLiteStudio – Explained

This is not a fork of the code.  
This is the *operational truth* behind the tool.

If you use SQLiteStudio and you've ever wondered:
- Why did my table get rebuilt?
- Where did my foreign keys go?
- Why does “commit” feel like demolition?

This repo documents the internal behavior of SQLiteStudio,  
not by theory – but by verified experimentation.
