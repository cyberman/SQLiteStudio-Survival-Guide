## Why this project still exists

This repo is **not a replacement**, but an **independent complement**.

We document:

- Unspoken behaviors of SQLiteStudio
- Real-world testing, table rebuild side effects
- Structural loss during commits
- Things the Wiki glosses over – or simply doesn't mention

---

> **The SQLiteStudio Survival Guide**  
> *Field-tested. Independently verified.*

When in doubt, consult both:
- The **official manual** for features & intent  
- This guide for **truth & implementation details**

Boingo-approved.
